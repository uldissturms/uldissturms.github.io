I'm a passionate software engineer, fanboy of TDD, BDD and functional programming. I'm expert in Javascript and a fast learner who follows best practices.

During my more than 10 year experience being an engineer I have:

 - reduced memory footprint
 - optimized T-SQL queries
 - tested legacy code by applying heavy refactorings
 - met hard deadlines being team lead

Today I love to skyrocket application performance by coming up with crazy ideas and suggestions. Reach out if you want to talk technology.
