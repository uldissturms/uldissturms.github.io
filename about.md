I'm a passionate .NET application developer, fanboy of BDD and TDD. I'm expert in C# and a fast learner who follows best practices such as SOLID (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion).

During my more than 9 year experience being a developer I have:

 - reduced memory footprint
 - optimized T-SQL queries
 - tested legacy code by applying heavy refactorings
 - hard deadlines being team lead

Today I love to skyrocket application performance by coming up with crazy ideas and suggestions. Reach out if you want to talk technology.
